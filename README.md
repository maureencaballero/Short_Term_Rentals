# Short_Term_Rentals

## Executive Summary

A sometimes controversial topic, Nashville’s short-term rental market has grown significantly over the past several years. In 2017, the Nashville metro council voted to disallow new non-owner occupied short-term rental permits to be issued in neighborhoods with R and RS zoning, which encompasses the bulk of residential Nashville neighborhoods. With this dramatic change combined with the COVID-19 effects on tourism, I’d like to explore the current short-term rental market in metro Nashville and visualize trends. 

## Motivation
Years ago, I purchased and managed rental properties as an income stream. That was before the age of “AirBnB.” Now there is a new option for renting out properties. I am curious about the state of the short-term rental market in metro Nashville. 

## Data Question(s)
-	Permit trends from April, 2015 through 2020 by type (multifamily, owner occupied, non-owner occupied), location, individual vs corporate. Specifically, how have the trends changed based on the 2017 ruling and the 2020 COVID-19 impact on tourism?

-	Types of rentals available (entire home/private room), by zip code or neighborhood
-	Minimum night rentals
-	Price range, by type and location
-	Reviews per month by type, price range, location
-	Number of listings by host
-	Days available out of 365
-	Host gender based on permit or listing – similarities/differences


## Minimally Viable Product (MVP)
Will have Tableau presentation that answers the Data Questions, having used Excel to analyze data.

## Data Sources
I will be using permit data provided by Nashville.gov, specifically “Residential Short-Term Permits” which includes data from April, 2015, through current day. I will also be analyzing data from a file simply called “listings.csv” from Inside Airbnb. There is another dataset called “listings.csv.gz” from the Inside Airbnb site that I will explore if I can convert the .gz to a basic .csv. Also, I will analyze complaints to the Nashville 311 Complaint line. Finally, I will look at the 2017 property values file from Davidson County to see if there is valuable information within that file and/or 2018 and 2019 property values if I can get that from Brad Pigue in the Davidson County Assessor’s Office. 

Also follow up on News Channel 5 investigation on 11/23 regarding investors buying up land for entire rental neighborhoods.
